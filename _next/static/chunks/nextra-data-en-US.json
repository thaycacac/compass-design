To mantain WCAG AA level of contrast ratio, colors are required to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, and 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders), with exception to text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component (disabled states).","rag-red-amber-and-green#RAG (Red, Amber, and Green)":"This palette should only be used to convey status or meaning for messages and feedback.
